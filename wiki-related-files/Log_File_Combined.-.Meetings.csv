Date,Length of Meeting (hours),Attendence,Summary,Design Decisions,Rationale for Design Decisions
1/8/2016,0.5,All present,"Everyone, before the meeting, found a potential customer with an app idea",Choose customer who wants a health-tracking application,"The other ideas seemed too difficult, given our experience"
,,,Discussed customers interviewed and their app ideas,"Don't go with app about encrypting (texts, emails, images)","The other ideas seemed to rely/need some sort of network integration, which we could not incoporate"
,,,Decided on which app to pursue,Don't go with app about video+subtitling,
,,,,Don’t' go with app about graphing generic data (but incorporate it into health-tracking),
,,,,Don't go with app that detects collisions in real life,
,,,,Don’t go with app that tracks business inquiries,
,,,,Don't go with tinder clone app for couches,
1/13/2016,1,All present,"Discussed health tracking app, gave it a name",Named app HealthTrack,WhatsApp group chat to coordinate meetings/informal discussions
,,,Discussed ideas about coordinating and organizing work,Use WhatsApp,Trello gave us an interface that looked like the Roadmap slide shown in class
,,,Discussed ideas about maintaining consistency in coding styles,Use Trello,Slack allows organized discussion about features as they can be subdivided into categories
,,,,Use Slack,Slack allows us to see/be notified of commits and comment on them
,,,,Scott will make the GitHub repo,Shared Google Drive folder allows coordinating files that are relevant to project but not part of the app (eg meetings files)
,,,,Check shared Drive folder/Trello for coding standards file,The graphing would require lots of work so we should start that first (algorithms to generate the graphics/graphs)
,,,,Integrate graphing/pie charts/statistical analysis into app,"Scott has a private GitHub repo we can use for this project, as we did not want the project available publicly (yet?)"
,,,,Allow customers to input data,Everyone should use JavaDocs when possible
,,,,Allow customers to input most eaten foods,"Everyone should include 4 files: the class, a version control/log file, test files, JavaDocs auto-generated HTML)"
1/15/2016,0.5,All present,Planned date for formal meeting with customer,Customer has inconvenient meeting hours,Everyone except Scott is busy during the hours the customer is available
,,,Recording equipment available through Scott,Scott will meet the customer and record the video himself,The customer cannot come to the university and arranging for rides to get to a place they can meet was daunting
,,,,,Spoke with professor and found that not everyone has to be present for the recording
,,,,,We thought up questions to ask the customer that Scott would ask and record the answers of
1/20/2016,2,All present,Brought individual vision statements together,Features:,The goals setting and flexibility would only require a few database calls and organization
,,,Combined into one vision statement,Goal settings + flexibilty,The customer should be able to input their own food + have a preloaded list to choose from. Two tables to maintain consistency and defaults
,,,Broke down video into (big/) user stories,Custom foods + pre-loaded foods from an existing database,The notifications will be used to tell the user of goal related information or warnings 
,,,Decided on which elements to not pursue,Push Notifications for user reminders,The foods should not be static images or information but interactable to allow user friendliness
,,,Estimated times of completion for each user story,Breakdown of foods for health content,
,,,"Prepped submission for Jan25,2016",,
1/27/2016,1,All present,Discussed app design (GUI made),Color scheme should be brighter,Brighter colors will make the app more vibrant
,,,Compiled ideas/resources for understanding Android development,We will be using a library to generate the Pie charts and graphs,We are allowed to use third party libraries (after speaking to professor)
,,,Review Google's android tutorials,,The third party libraries save days on the statistical information display user story
,,,Discussed Chart Library use,,
2/8/2016,1,All present,Discussed GUI colour and refactoring,We decided to use peach colours,Background was unusable on larger devices
,,,Added Canadian Nutrition File (CNF),Added the CNF files to the Android file,The CNF files have nutritional information and we can easily extract whatever rows we need/want 
2/21/2016,4,All present,Updated hours of user stories,We will research standard Android GUIs,"Android has standard features so that we don't have to spend time ""reinventing the wheel"""
,,,Prepped submission of Itr1,We have to put more emphasis on coding standards,Emphasizing coding standards will make it easier to understand each other's code
,,,Re-estimated times of completion for each user story,Reduced estimates,"Estimates were inflated as per Itr0 grading, and needed to be re-evaluated"
,,,Updated the priority of Statistical Feature,Made Statistical Features a High Priority,We felt this was a feature that made the app stand out the most as visually representing the numbers generated by this app will be its selling point
